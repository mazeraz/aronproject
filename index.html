            Angel’s Burger is so popular that anyone and everyone can see it everywhere. It has more than a thousand outlets all over the Philippines.
             A lot of roadside breaks and late-night snacks have been spent on these burgers.
            <br>

            The very successful business known for its Buy 1, Take 1 Burger, had its humble beginnings. In fact, one of the owners was even an employee in a 
            bank, Vicky Mojica.
            This “Burger ng Bayan,” is the baby of Joseph and Vicky Mojica’s leap of faith. These two ‘regular’ employees quit their jobs during the ’90s, 
            franchised a burger business and also ventured into several more businesses.

        <p class="aboutdako1">History:</p>
        <p class="about1">
            Before the triumph of Angel’s Burger, it all started from humble beginnings. The success story was not like a fairytale; there was drought, difficulties, and a quest for stability. However, it was really inspiring, especially for those 
            aspiring entrepreneurs who are just starting to step outside of their comfort zone. <br><br>
            Let’s go back to when the story started, in the 90’s, the husband-and-wife tandem, Vicky and Joseph, decided to resign from their respective jobs. They sought for new opportunities particularly in businesses, because they don’t want to rely on their 
            incomes from endless employment.
